# model an employee using ruby

# employee2 = ["Danilo", "Campos", 100000, false]

# p "#{employee2[0]} #{employee2[1]} makes $#{employee2[2]} per year."



# hash
employee1 = {"last_name" => "Carter", "salary" => 80000, "active" => true, "first_name" => "Majora"}
# employee2 = {:first_name => "Danilo", :last_name => "Campos", :salary => 100000, :active => false}
# fancy version of the above line
employee2 = {first_name: "Danilo", last_name: "Campos", salary: 100000, active: false}
# p employee2


# what is the easies update i could do?
# chaging the name?




p "#{employee1['first_name']} #{employee1['last_name']} makes $#{employee1['salary']} per year."
p "#{employee2[:first_name]} #{employee2[:last_name]} makes $#{employee2[:salary]} per year."





# What's better? hash or array? why?






# object





# What do we need to do to make this?
